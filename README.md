# Team 4 Project
*The project aims to develop a modernized and more feature-rich replacement to the existing system. The new system will offer enhanced functionality, improved data presentation, and an advanced search feature for users interested in projectile points and lithic artifacts.*

## Project Description

### What the Application Does
A web app that serves as a catalog management system tailored for anyone with private collections of archaeological artifacts. The primary focus is on creating a user-friendly platform for managing, maintaining, and growing personal collections of projectile points and other artifacts. It addresses the need for a more modern software option in this domain.

### Tech Stack

- React.js (JavaScript)
- Bootstrap

#### Backend

### Planned Features
1. **Admin Account Privileges:** Ability for admins to add, modify, and delete points, and potentially add new admin/user accounts.
2. **Catalog Management:** Admins can add new points to the catalog with attributes for each point.
3. **Public Accessibility:** All users can view the catalog and details of points in a user-friendly manner.
4. **Import/Export Feature:** Admins can export data to a CSV file and import data to the web app.
5. **Data Aggregation:** Aggregating data points to provide average details and statistics based on common attributes.
6. **Search and Filter Functionality:** Allowing users to search and filter projectile points by attributes like material, site, and culture (planned as a stretch feature).
